# üß† Salesforce

This repository showcases my hands-on experience and learning with Salesforce. It includes projects built using Flows, Lightning App Builder, custom objects, validation rules, and automation tools.

My goal is to demonstrate how I apply Salesforce concepts to real-world business problems ‚Äî such as customer management, service processes, and workflow automation
