# ðŸ§  Salesforce
This repository showcases my hands-on experience and learning with Salesforce. It includes projects built using Flows, Lightning App Builder, custom objects, validation rules, and automation tools.
My goal is to demonstrate how I apply Salesforce concepts to real-world business problems â€” such as customer management, service processes, and workflow automation
